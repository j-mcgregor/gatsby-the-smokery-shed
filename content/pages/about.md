  At The Smokery Shed, we take food seriously. All our food is freshly prepared
  in our Wokingham kitchen with the highest hygiene practices. We use the
  freshest ingredients sourced from the best food suppliers. Where possible, we
  choose locally grown food created with sustainable & free-range farming
  processes.


  Fi started small in her Reading kitchen, catering at weekends whilst working
  in an office during the week. She soon found that people were looking for
  something different - beautiful food with a difference. She learnt to smoke
  food, offering this as part of her menus and has never looked back!
