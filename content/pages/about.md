  At The Smokery Shed, we take food seriously. All our food is freshly prepared
  in our Wokingham kitchen with the highest hygiene practices. We use the
  freshest ingredients sourced from the best food suppliers. Where possible, we
  choose locally grown food created with sustainable & free-range farming
  processes.
