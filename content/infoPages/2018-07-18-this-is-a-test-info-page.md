  - title: What are your minimum & maximum number requirements?
    content: >-
      We can cater up to 100 people for a buffet, 65 for a sit-down dinner & 45
      for afternoon tea. Our minimum numbers vary depending on the event.
  - title: 'Can you provide hire equipment such as crockery, cutlery & linen?'
    content: >-
      We can provide linen (tablecloths & napkins) for up to 20 people and we
      can recommend local companies for the remainder. 
  - title: 'I have a guest with a nut allergy, are you able to cater?'
    content: >-
      We can cater for a range of allergies, however due to our business we
      handle nuts regularly so we cannot provide services to someone with a nut
      allergy. 
  - title: What are your payment terms?
    content: >-
      We take 50% of the total amount at the time of booking and the remainder 4
      weeks prior to the event. We accept cash, cheques & BACS. 
  - title: 'Our wedding is in a marquee, can you provide the equipment and the food?'
    content: >-
      Depending on the facilities on-site and your guest numbers, we should be
      able to help. Essential services such as electricity, water & waste must
      be provided by the location. 
  - title: Are you an environmentally conscious business?
    content: >-
      Yes. We always endeavour to source food as locally as we can, wherever
      possible. Our buffets use porcelain platters (provided by us and collected
      after your event), napkins and tablecloths are linen and our disposable
      plates and crockery are bamboo and compostable. 


      We recycle as much of equipment as possible and can provide a copy of a
      Environmental Statement upon request.
